# MIRTO-Emulator


 A racket language base project to build an emulator for the Middlesex RoboTic platfOrm (MIRTO).
 The purpose, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown where the students were forced to stay at home,
 is to allow students the testing of their racket code without having a physical MIRTO robot.
 To simplify the usage of this emulator, there were used only the basic library included with the
 standard installation of Drracket.
