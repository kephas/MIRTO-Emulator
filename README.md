# MIRTO-Emulator


 A racket language base project to build an emulator for the Middlesex RoboTic platfOrm (MIRTO).
 The purpose, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown where the students were forced to stay at home,
 is to allow students the testing of their racket code without having a physical MIRTO robot.
 To simplify the usage of this emulator, there were used only the basic library included with the
 standard installation of Drracket.

## Bot area

The bot area represents the bot movements. The start position is set at x:80 y:300 z:0 close the black line but it is possible to interact to change the coordinates and the direction.
Clicking on the bot with the left mouse button the positioning mode is enabled, to place the bot simply move it in the positioning mode and click again the mouse left button to replace it. It is possible to rotate the bot in the positioning mode clicking the mouse right button. It is possible to choose between height positions (0° 45° 90° 135° 180° 225° 270° 315°).
